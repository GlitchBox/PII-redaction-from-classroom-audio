The user must have **python3** installed. The user should also have the following packages installed before they download the project:
- transformers
- gTTS
- assemblyai

The next step would be simply downloading the project. Then the user should unzip it and open a terminal (or command prompt for Windows) inside the unzipped folder. In the terminal, the user will have to execute the following command:

`python3 main.py [path of the audio]`

The result would be an audio file with PII replaced with dummy data. The title of the audio file would be **PII_replaced.mp3**.
